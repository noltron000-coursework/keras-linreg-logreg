## Homework 1:

1- Build a Keras Model for linear regression (check: https://keras.io/activations/). Use Boston Housing Dataset to train and test your model

2- Build a Keras Model for logistic regression. Use diabetes.csv to train and test

Comments:

1- Build the **simplest model** for linear regression with Keras and compare your model performance with `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`

2- Build the **simplest model** for logistic regression with Keras and compare your model performance with `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`

3- **Add more complexity to your models in (1) and (2)** and compare with previous results
