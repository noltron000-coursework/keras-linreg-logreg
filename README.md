# Keras Refresher
Be sure to check out [Keras' Documentation][keras] before you start out!

## Linear Regression
1. Build a Keras Model for linear regression (check: https://keras.io/activations/). Use Boston Housing Dataset to train and test your model.
1. Build the **simplest model** for logistic regression with Keras and compare your model performance with `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`

## Logistic Regression
1. Build a Keras Model for logistic regression. Use `diabetes.csv` to train and test your model.
1. Build the **simplest model** for linear regression with Keras and compare your model performance with `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`
